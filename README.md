# GC vs AOH Disstrack Timeline

I will try to make this as unbais as I can.
If anyone is interested in helping me update this timeline please contact me and i'll add all info!

## How it started
It all started with Steven & Lil Stick throwing digs and Gladius, calling them snakes in our Mutiny Diss

## Hellforce responded
First of all he responded with a really bad low quality diss but I am unable to find it. (Hellforce if you're reading this and want to add it to the timeline hit me up)

He then released a better version as an MP3 file
